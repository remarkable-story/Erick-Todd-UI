## Task 1: Set Up The Project With Git

  

* [x] Fork the project into your GitHub user account

* [x] Clone the forked project into a directory on your machine

* [x] You are now ready to build this project with your preferred IDE

  

## Task 2: Set Up LESS Preprocessor

* [x] Verify that you have LESS installed correctly by running `lessc -v` in your terminal, if you don't get a version message back, reach out to your project manager for help.

* [x] Open your terminal and navigate to your preprocessing project by using the `cd` command

* [x] Once in your project's root folder, run the following command `less-watch-compiler less css index.less`

* [x] Verify your compiler is working correctly by changing the `background-color` on the `html` selector to `red` in your `index.less` file.

* [x] Once you see the red screen, you can delete that style and you're ready to start on the next task
